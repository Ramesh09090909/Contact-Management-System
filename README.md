# Contact-Management-System
Contact Management System, built using Python's Tkinter library, allows users to manage their contacts through a simple graphical interface. Users can add, edit, delete, and view contacts, where each contact includes a name, phone number, and email address. The system stores contacts in a list, and supports saving and loading contacts from a JSON file, ensuring data persistence between sessions. The program also handles input validation and provides feedback to users through message boxes for errors or success.This user-friendly tool is suitable for managing a small number of contacts and offers functionalities such as editing and deleting specific entries based on the contact index.
